#### Snoop around, have some fun!

I had never written a line of Objective-C or OpenGL in my life before this adventure so it might not all be up to standards.

You can find some more information about the game on the [official webpage](http://www.eveofimpact.com) or, of course, on the [AppStore](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eve-of-impact/id465159205?ls=1&mt=8). There's also a game trailer you can view on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqJuuV78Qug), queue Inception bwaaaaaap!
